# ns-food-analysis

Okay, this is a fantastic project area with lots of potential! Your synopsis covers the core network types well. Let's brainstorm some interesting extensions and structure the tasks chronologically.

**Interesting Ideas & Improvisations:**

1.  **Nutrient Synergy/Antagonism Network:**
    *   **Idea:** Instead of just correlation, build a *directed* nutrient-nutrient network based on known biochemical interactions (requires external knowledge beyond the dataset). Edges could represent enhancement (e.g., Vitamin C -> Iron absorption), inhibition (e.g., Phytic Acid -> Zinc absorption), or cofactor relationships (e.g., Magnesium -> ATP utilization).
    *   **Why it's interesting:** Moves beyond statistical co-occurrence to functional relationships, offering deeper dietary planning insights.

2.  **Food Complementarity Network:**
    *   **Idea:** Define a "nutritional completeness" score for each food (e.g., based on % Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage across multiple nutrients). Then, build a food-food network where edges represent *complementarity* â€“ how well two foods together achieve a more complete profile than either alone. Edge weight could be the increase in completeness score when combined.
    *   **Why it's interesting:** Directly addresses balanced diet creation by identifying food pairings that fill nutritional gaps.

3.  **Nutrient Density Weighted Networks:**
    *   **Idea:** Modify your existing network edge weights. Instead of raw quantity (e.g., 10mg Vitamin C), use nutrient density (e.g., mg Vitamin C / 100 kcal). Re-run centrality and community detection.
    *   **Why it's interesting:** Highlights foods that are nutrient powerhouses relative to their energy content, shifting focus from just high-quantity sources (which might also be high-calorie) to efficient sources.

4.  **Graph Embeddings for Food & Nutrients (Leads to GNNs):**
    *   **Idea:** Use techniques like Node2Vec, DeepWalk, or GraphSAGE on your food-nutrient bipartite graph (or other constructed graphs) to learn vector representations (embeddings) for each food and nutrient.
    *   **Why it's interesting:**
        *   These embeddings capture complex network topology and relationships.
        *   Can be used for similarity searches (find foods/nutrients similar to X based on network role).
        *   Can be used as input features for machine learning tasks (see GNNs below).
        *   Can visualize high-dimensional relationships in 2D/3D space (e.g., using t-SNE or UMAP on embeddings).

5.  **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Applications:**
    *   **a) Nutrient Prediction (Link Prediction):** Train a GNN on the food-nutrient bipartite graph to predict the quantity of a specific nutrient for a food where it might be missing or unmeasured. The GNN learns from the food's connections to other nutrients and potentially similar foods' connections.
    *   **b) Food Categorization (Node Classification):** Using the learned food embeddings (from Idea 4) or directly training a GNN, classify foods into predefined (e.g., 'Fruit', 'Vegetable', 'Meat') or emergent categories based on their network position and nutritional profile. Compare GNN-derived categories with standard food groups.
    *   **c) Identifying Atypical Foods (Anomaly Detection):** Foods whose predicted nutrient profile (using GNNs) significantly differs from their actual profile might be outliers or have unique nutritional characteristics worth investigating.

6.  **Multi-Layer Network Analysis:**
    *   **Idea:** Formally combine multiple networks. Layer 1: Food-Nutrient (content). Layer 2: Nutrient-Nutrient (correlation/synergy). Layer 3: Food-Food (similarity/complementarity). Analyze how central nodes in one layer relate to their position/role in other layers.
    *   **Why it's interesting:** Provides a holistic view, integrating different types of relationships simultaneously.

7.  **Network Robustness & Dietary Gaps:**
    *   **Idea:** Simulate removing certain food groups (e.g., all dairy) or specific hub foods (identified via centrality). How does this affect the overall nutrient availability or connectivity in the remaining network? Which nutrients become "vulnerable" (hard to obtain)?
    *   **Why it's interesting:** Models the impact of dietary restrictions or food supply issues on nutritional coverage.

**Chronological Task List & Analysis Pipeline:**

*(Incorporating ideas from the synopsis and the suggestions above)*

1.  **Data Acquisition & Initial Exploration:**
    *   Load the dataset (8789 food items).
    *   Perform basic EDA: check data types, distributions of key nutrients (calories, protein, fat, carbs, key vitamins/minerals), identify missing values, understand units.

2.  **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
    *   **Handle Missing Values:** Decide on a strategy (e.g., imputation using mean/median/zero, or dropping columns/rows if missingness is too high). *Crucial step.*
    *   **Unit Standardization:** Convert all nutrient values to a consistent unit where meaningful (e.g., mg for minerals/vitamins, g for macros). Pay attention to IU conversions if possible/necessary.
    *   **Normalization/Scaling:** Since nutrient quantities vary vastly (g vs mcg), normalize data before certain analyses (e.g., correlation, similarity calculations, GNN input). Options: Min-Max scaling, Z-score standardization, or perhaps normalization based on RDAs if available.
    *   **Feature Selection:** Decide which nutrients/columns to include in the network analysis. Include macros, key micros, amino acids. Exclude purely descriptive columns unless needed (e.g., serving size if always 100g).
    *   **(Optional) Food Categorization:** Add a column for pre-defined food groups if available or derive basic ones from names (e.g., 'Nuts', 'Fruit', 'Vegetable', 'Meat').

3.  **Network Construction:**
    *   **a) Food-Nutrient Bipartite Graph:**
        *   Nodes: Foods (Set F), Nutrients (Set N).
        *   Edges: Connect food `f` to nutrient `n` if `f` contains `n`.
        *   Edge Weights:
            *   Option 1: Raw quantity (standardized/normalized).
            *   Option 2: Nutrient density (quantity / calories).
            *   Option 3: Binary (presence/absence above a threshold).
            *   *Choose and justify your weighting scheme.*
    *   **b) Nutrient Co-occurrence/Correlation Network:**
        *   Nodes: Nutrients.
        *   Edges: Connect nutrient `n1` to `n2` if they frequently co-occur across foods.
        *   Edge Weights: Calculate correlation (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) between nutrient vectors across all foods. Use absolute correlation value or thresholded value.
    *   **c) Food Similarity Network:**
        *   Nodes: Foods.
        *   Edges: Connect food `f1` to `f2` if their nutritional profiles are similar.
        *   Edge Weights: Calculate similarity (e.g., Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance inverted) between food nutrient vectors (use normalized data).
    *   **(Advanced) d) Nutrient Synergy/Antagonism Network:** (Requires external data lookup).
    *   **(Advanced) e) Food Complementarity Network:** (Requires defining completeness score & complementarity metric).

4.  **Fundamental Network Analysis & Visualization:**
    *   **Compute Basic Metrics:** For relevant networks (especially Food-Nutrient projected graphs or Nutrient-Nutrient/Food-Food):
        *   Degree Centrality (identify well-connected foods/nutrients).
        *   Betweenness Centrality (identify bridge foods/nutrients).
        *   Closeness Centrality (identify foods/nutrients quickly accessible).
        *   PageRank/Eigenvector Centrality (identify influential foods/nutrients).
    *   **Clustering Coefficient:** Measure local cohesiveness (do nutrients found in one food tend to be correlated? Do similar foods share neighbours?).
    *   **Visualization:** Use Gephi or Python libraries (NetworkX with Matplotlib/Seaborn, PyVis, Plotly) to visualize the networks. Use node size/color based on centrality or food category. Use edge thickness/color based on weights.

5.  **Community Detection & Structure Analysis:**
    *   Apply algorithms (e.g., Louvain Modularity, Girvan-Newman) to:
        *   Food-Nutrient Bipartite Graph (communities might represent dietary patterns or functional groups).
        *   Nutrient-Nutrient Network (identify clusters of related nutrients, e.g., B vitamins, electrolytes, fat-soluble vitamins).
        *   Food-Food Network (identify clusters of nutritionally similar foods, compare with standard food groups).
    *   Calculate Modularity score to assess the quality of detected communities.

6.  **Advanced Network Analysis & Interpretation:**
    *   **Hub Analysis:** Deep dive into the top central nodes identified in step 4. What makes "nuts" or "liver" or "Vitamin C" hubs in different network contexts?
    *   **Nutritional Gap Analysis:** Identify foods with very low degree or specific nutrient deficiencies based on network position. Analyze isolated nodes/components.
    *   **Complementarity Analysis:** Use the Food Complementarity Network (if built) or analyze anti-communities (groups of nodes with few internal links but many external ones) in the Food Similarity Network.
    *   **Robustness Simulation:** Perform node removal simulations (step 7 in ideas) to test dietary resilience.

7.  **(Optional) Graph Embeddings & GNN Implementation:**
    *   **Generate Embeddings:** Apply Node2Vec/DeepWalk/GraphSAGE to the Food-Nutrient bipartite graph.
    *   **Visualize Embeddings:** Use t-SNE/UMAP to visualize food/nutrient relationships in 2D. Check if known food groups cluster together.
    *   **Implement GNN Task(s):**
        *   Set up and train a GNN for Link Prediction (nutrient quantity estimation). Evaluate accuracy.
        *   Set up and train a GNN for Node Classification (food category prediction). Evaluate accuracy (e.g., F1-score, compare to standard groups).

8.  **Synthesis, Evaluation & Reporting:**
    *   Synthesize findings from all analyses. Do results from different network types reinforce each other?
    *   Evaluate how well the network models addressed the project objectives.
    *   Relate findings back to nutritional science and dietary recommendations. What are the practical implications?
    *   Document the methodology, results (including key visualizations), and conclusions clearly.

Remember to start with the core tasks from your synopsis and gradually add complexity. The GNN parts are more advanced and might depend on your computational resources and time. Good luck!
