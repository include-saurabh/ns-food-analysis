# ns-food-analysis

1.  **Data Acquisition & Initial Exploration:**
    *   Load the dataset (8789 food items).
    *   Perform basic EDA: check data types, distributions of key nutrients (calories, protein, fat, carbs, key vitamins/minerals), identify missing values, understand units.

2.  **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
    *   **Handle Missing Values:** Decide on a strategy (e.g., imputation using mean/median/zero, or dropping columns/rows if missingness is too high). *Crucial step.*
    *   **Unit Standardization:** Convert all nutrient values to a consistent unit where meaningful (e.g., mg for minerals/vitamins, g for macros). Pay attention to IU conversions if possible/necessary.
    *   **Normalization/Scaling:** Since nutrient quantities vary vastly (g vs mcg), normalize data before certain analyses (e.g., correlation, similarity calculations, GNN input). Options: Min-Max scaling, Z-score standardization, or perhaps normalization based on RDAs if available.
    *   **Feature Selection:** Decide which nutrients/columns to include in the network analysis. Include macros, key micros, amino acids. Exclude purely descriptive columns unless needed (e.g., serving size if always 100g).
    *   **(Optional) Food Categorization:** Add a column for pre-defined food groups if available or derive basic ones from names (e.g., 'Nuts', 'Fruit', 'Vegetable', 'Meat').

3.  **Network Construction:**
    *   **a) Food-Nutrient Bipartite Graph:**
        *   Nodes: Foods (Set F), Nutrients (Set N).
        *   Edges: Connect food `f` to nutrient `n` if `f` contains `n`.
        *   Edge Weights:
            *   Option 1: Raw quantity (standardized/normalized).
            *   Option 2: Nutrient density (quantity / calories).
            *   Option 3: Binary (presence/absence above a threshold).
            *   *Choose and justify your weighting scheme.*
    *   **b) Nutrient Co-occurrence/Correlation Network:**
        *   Nodes: Nutrients.
        *   Edges: Connect nutrient `n1` to `n2` if they frequently co-occur across foods.
        *   Edge Weights: Calculate correlation (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) between nutrient vectors across all foods. Use absolute correlation value or thresholded value.
    *   **c) Food Similarity Network:**
        *   Nodes: Foods.
        *   Edges: Connect food `f1` to `f2` if their nutritional profiles are similar.
        *   Edge Weights: Calculate similarity (e.g., Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance inverted) between food nutrient vectors (use normalized data).
    *   **(Advanced) d) Nutrient Synergy/Antagonism Network:** (Requires external data lookup).
    *   **(Advanced) e) Food Complementarity Network:** (Requires defining completeness score & complementarity metric).

4.  **Fundamental Network Analysis & Visualization:**
    *   **Compute Basic Metrics:** For relevant networks (especially Food-Nutrient projected graphs or Nutrient-Nutrient/Food-Food):
        *   Degree Centrality (identify well-connected foods/nutrients).
        *   Betweenness Centrality (identify bridge foods/nutrients).
        *   Closeness Centrality (identify foods/nutrients quickly accessible).
        *   PageRank/Eigenvector Centrality (identify influential foods/nutrients).
    *   **Clustering Coefficient:** Measure local cohesiveness (do nutrients found in one food tend to be correlated? Do similar foods share neighbours?).
    *   **Visualization:** Use Gephi or Python libraries (NetworkX with Matplotlib/Seaborn, PyVis, Plotly) to visualize the networks. Use node size/color based on centrality or food category. Use edge thickness/color based on weights.

5.  **Community Detection & Structure Analysis:**
    *   Apply algorithms (e.g., Louvain Modularity, Girvan-Newman) to:
        *   Food-Nutrient Bipartite Graph (communities might represent dietary patterns or functional groups).
        *   Nutrient-Nutrient Network (identify clusters of related nutrients, e.g., B vitamins, electrolytes, fat-soluble vitamins).
        *   Food-Food Network (identify clusters of nutritionally similar foods, compare with standard food groups).
    *   Calculate Modularity score to assess the quality of detected communities.

6.  **Advanced Network Analysis & Interpretation:**
    *   **Hub Analysis:** Deep dive into the top central nodes identified in step 4. What makes "nuts" or "liver" or "Vitamin C" hubs in different network contexts?
    *   **Nutritional Gap Analysis:** Identify foods with very low degree or specific nutrient deficiencies based on network position. Analyze isolated nodes/components.
    *   **Complementarity Analysis:** Use the Food Complementarity Network (if built) or analyze anti-communities (groups of nodes with few internal links but many external ones) in the Food Similarity Network.
    *   **Robustness Simulation:** Perform node removal simulations (step 7 in ideas) to test dietary resilience.

7.  **(Optional) Graph Embeddings & GNN Implementation:**
    *   **Generate Embeddings:** Apply Node2Vec/DeepWalk/GraphSAGE to the Food-Nutrient bipartite graph.
    *   **Visualize Embeddings:** Use t-SNE/UMAP to visualize food/nutrient relationships in 2D. Check if known food groups cluster together.
    *   **Implement GNN Task(s):**
        *   Set up and train a GNN for Link Prediction (nutrient quantity estimation). Evaluate accuracy.
        *   Set up and train a GNN for Node Classification (food category prediction). Evaluate accuracy (e.g., F1-score, compare to standard groups).

8.  **Synthesis, Evaluation & Reporting:**
    *   Synthesize findings from all analyses. Do results from different network types reinforce each other?
    *   Evaluate how well the network models addressed the project objectives.
    *   Relate findings back to nutritional science and dietary recommendations. What are the practical implications?
    *   Document the methodology, results (including key visualizations), and conclusions clearly.

Remember to start with the core tasks from your synopsis and gradually add complexity. The GNN parts are more advanced and might depend on your computational resources and time. Good luck!
